* Pen.el contrib library

Integration of =pen.el= with other emacs packages.

I have kept this separated to help distinguish
what is core from what is less important a
part of =pen.el=.

** =pen-org-brain=
I combine GPT-3 with org-brain to expand on topics, suggesting subtopics and providing an interactive tutor for any topic.

- Subtopic generation
- explore arbitrary topics with =pen.el=
- automatically generating subtopics
- invoke the GPT-3 tutor to answer questions within that context

** TODO =pen-org-roam=
Aim to be a loom-like library for emacs.
